/**
 * This class is responsible for creating the top level services like {@link OTPConfiguration}
 * and {@link OTPServer}. The purpose of this class is to wire the
 * application, creating the necessary Services and modules and putting them together.
 * It is NOT responsible for starting or running the application. The whole idea of this
 * class is to separate application construction from running it.
 *
 * <p> The top level construction class(this class) may delegate to other construction classes
 * to inject configuration and services into sub-modules.
 *
 * <p> THIS CLASS IS NOT THREAD SAFE - THE APPLICATION SHOULD BE CREATED IN ONE THREAD. This
 * should be really fast, since the only IO operations are reading config files and logging.
 * Loading transit or map data should NOT happen during this phase.
